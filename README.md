## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Local web server (optional, but recommended for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antcoop-vu/leaflet-experiments.git
   cd leaflet-experiments/contact-map
   ```

2. **Open any HTML file in your browser:**
   - `index.html` - Restaurant contact map
   - `nashville-pizza.html` - Pizza location finder
   - `nashville-traffic.html` - Traffic incident dashboard

3. **For development with live reload (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have live-server installed)
   npx live-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Component Architecture
- **Alpine.js data stores** for state management
